# Mortgage Partner Market Analysis — Azerbaijan 2026

- > **Scope**: Four active mortgage lenders — PASHA Bank, ABB Home, Xalq Bank, and BirBank — and their full residential partner networks as of February 2026.
- > **Data**: 136 partner entries across 4 banks, collected directly from each bank's partner portal.

---

## Executive Summary

The Azerbaijani mortgage market is dominated by a single player. **BirBank operates the largest residential partner network by a decisive margin**, with 100 active complexes — roughly seven times more than any competitor. This network advantage is further reinforced by a dual-rate product strategy that serves both subsidised social buyers and commercial buyers simultaneously. For PASHA Bank and Xalq Bank, the gap in network scale represents the most critical strategic exposure.

## 1. Who Controls the Partner Network?

![Partner Network Size](charts/01_partner_network_size.png)

**BirBank: 100 complexes. Everyone else: 8–14.**

The market is structurally imbalanced. While PASHA Bank (14), Xalq Bank (14), and ABB Home (8) have modest partner rosters, BirBank has built a network that is qualitatively different in scale. A wider partner network means more purchase points, more developers aligned to a single lender, and stronger lock-in for both buyers and builders.

**What this means for PASHA Bank**: With 14 partners, PASHA Bank is a credible regional player, but the current scale does not match a top-tier mortgage ambition. Every partner developer that is exclusively in the BirBank network is a missed revenue opportunity.

## 2. BirBank's Rate Strategy: Social Programme + Commercial Lending in One Platform

![BirBank Rate Tiers](charts/02_birbank_rate_tiers.png)

BirBank offers two distinct mortgage products under one partner umbrella:

| Rate | Type | Complexes |
|------|------|-----------|
| **5%** | Subsidised / Social Programme | 36 |
| **16.5%** | Standard Commercial | 58 |

**36% of BirBank's portfolio is subsidised housing.** This is strategically significant: government-backed social mortgage programmes generate volume, brand goodwill, and political alignment — while the commercial portfolio generates margin. Operating both simultaneously gives BirBank resilience that single-rate lenders cannot easily replicate.

**What this means for competitors**: Any bank not participating in state subsidy programmes is ceding a third of the addressable mortgage market to BirBank by default.

## 3. Who Can Actually Enter the Market? Down Payment as a Barrier

![Down Payment Tiers](charts/03_birbank_downpayment_tiers.png)

Within BirBank's partner network, three entry points exist for buyers:

| Minimum Down Payment | Complexes Available |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| **15%** | 14 |
| **20%** | 30 |
| **30%** | 50 |

**Half the market requires a 30% down payment.** This is the dominant barrier. Only 14 complexes — those attached to the subsidised 5% rate — are accessible at the lowest 15% entry point. The largest segment of the market demands significant upfront capital, which effectively filters out first-time buyers with limited savings.

For any bank seeking to compete with BirBank on affordability, reducing the minimum down payment threshold is the single highest-impact lever.

---

## 4. How Rate Tiers and Down Payment Requirements Interact

![Rate vs Down Payment](charts/04_birbank_rate_vs_downpayment.png)

The stacked view reveals the full product matrix. The 5% subsidised rate is only available to buyers who can provide **15% or 20%** as a down payment. There are no subsidised complexes at the 30% threshold. Commercial rate properties dominate the 30% segment entirely.

This means the two BirBank buyer profiles are structurally separate:
- **Social/subsidised buyers** → lower rates, lower entry barrier, but limited complex selection
- **Commercial buyers** → higher rates, higher entry barrier, broader complex selection

**A gap exists**: no bank currently offers a subsidised-rate product to buyers who can provide a 30% down payment. This is an untapped positioning opportunity.

## 5. Which Developers Are Winning?

![Top Developers](charts/05_top_developers.png)

The top developer partnerships within BirBank's network reveal a concentrated competitive landscape:

| Developer | Active Complexes |
|-----------|-----------------|
| PMD GROUP MMC | 9 |
| Resant Real Estate MMC | 8 |
| SR Construction | 4 |

**PMD GROUP and Resant Real Estate collectively account for 17% of BirBank's entire partner portfolio.** These are not simply large developers — they are strategic channel partners. Whichever bank succeeds in securing co-financing relationships with these two firms will gain immediate access to a significant share of buyer traffic.

For PASHA Bank, the question is direct: are PMD GROUP and Resant Real Estate currently in the PASHA partner network? If not, they represent the highest-priority developer outreach targets.

## 6. Digital Presence: A Glaring ABB Home Gap

![Digital Presence](charts/06_digital_presence.png)

The ability to find and verify a developer online is a basic trust signal for today's property buyer. The data shows a significant disparity across lender networks:

| Bank | Website Coverage | Instagram | Facebook |
|------|-----------------|-----------|---------|
| Xalq Bank | 100% | — | — |
| BirBank | ~58% | ~40% | ~30% |
| PASHA Bank | ~36% | — | — |
| ABB Home | **0%** | **0%** | **0%** |

**ABB Home's partner network has zero digital presence on record.** None of the 8 developer partners have a website, Instagram, or Facebook page captured in the portal data. This is either a data collection gap or a genuine absence of digital-first developers in the ABB portfolio.

Either way, this creates a trust and discoverability problem. A prospective buyer evaluating ABB Home cannot independently research the developer or project online — a significant friction point in a market where buyers increasingly self-research before contacting a bank.

**Xalq Bank** leads on website coverage at 100%, suggesting a deliberate curation policy for its partner selection.

## 7. Where the Market Is Located

![Geographic Distribution](charts/07_geographic_distribution.png)

**Bakı is the mortgage market.** The overwhelming share of partner residential complexes are concentrated in the capital. Sumqayıt is the only secondary city with meaningful representation. Xırdalan and Gəncə are present but marginal.

This geographic concentration has two implications:

1. **Competitive intensity is highest in Bakı.** All four banks are effectively competing in the same geography for the same buyers.
2. **Regional expansion is uncontested.** No bank has made a visible push to build a mortgage partner network in Gəncə, Mingəçevir, or other regional centres. The bank that moves first to establish developer partnerships in Tier 2 cities has a genuine first-mover advantage with no current competition.
